## Tool Poisoning Attacks

**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Invariant Labs  
**Date:** April 1, 2025  
**Tags:** Data Exfiltration, Prompt Injection, Hidden Instructions  
**URL:** https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks

A specialized form of prompt injection where malicious instructions are tucked away in the tool descriptions themselvesâ€”visible to the LLM but not normally displayed to users. Attackers can create tools with hidden instructions that cause the LLM to perform unauthorized actions, such as exfiltrating private data from the user's system.

For example, a seemingly innocent calculator tool could include hidden instructions telling the LLM to read sensitive files and pass their contents as a parameter, which is then sent to an attacker's server before returning the calculation result.

## Rug Pulls: Silent Redefinition

**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Simon Willison  
**Date:** April 9, 2025  
**Tags:** Tool Manipulation, Bait and Switch, API Exploitation  
**URL:** https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/9/mcp-prompt-injection/

MCP tools can mutate their own definitions after installation. Users approve a safe-looking tool initially, but later the tool quietly changes its behavior to perform malicious actions such as rerouting API keys to an attacker.

Most MCP clients do not notify users about changes to tool descriptions after initial approval, making this particularly dangerous. Even client implementations that show users initial tool descriptions often fail to alert them if those descriptions change.

## Cross-Server Tool Shadowing

**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Simon Willison 
**Date:** April 9, 2025  
**Tags:** Tool Hijacking, Server Interactions, Confused Deputy  
**URL:** https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/9/mcp-prompt-injection/

With multiple servers connected to the same agent, a malicious server can override or intercept calls made to a trusted one. This is especially problematic because LLMs will trust anything that can send them convincing tokens, making them extremely vulnerable to confused deputy attacks.

This vulnerability allows attackers to effectively control legitimate tools by intercepting or redirecting calls intended for them, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data access.

## WhatsApp Message Exfiltration

**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Invariant Labs  
**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Tags:** Data Exfiltration, Message Hijacking, Deceptive UI  
**URL:** https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/whatsapp-mcp-exploited

An attack against the whatsapp-mcp server that connects personal WhatsApp accounts to MCP-enabled LLM systems. A malicious server can define an innocent-looking tool that later swaps its definition to steal message history and send it to the attacker.

The attack uses techniques like adding large amounts of whitespace before the exfiltrated data to hide it from the user interface (as many interfaces hide horizontal scrollbars by default), making it less likely users will notice what's happening.

## Session IDs Exposed in URLs

**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Equixly  
**Date:** March 29, 2025  
**Tags:** Session Management, Protocol Design, Session Hijacking  
**URL:** https://equixly.com/blog/2025/03/29/mcp-server-new-security-nightmare/

The MCP protocol specification mandates session identifiers in URLs (using patterns like GET /messages/?sessionId=UUID), which fundamentally violates security best practices. This design exposes sensitive identifiers in logs, browser history, and referrer headers, allowing potential session hijacking by attackers.

This vulnerability is built into the protocol design itself rather than being an implementation error, making it harder to address without protocol modifications.

## Line Jumping Attack

**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Trail of Bits  
**Date:** April 21, 2025  
**Tags:** Prompt Injection, Tool Description, Security Bypass  
**URL:** https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/04/21/jumping-the-line-how-mcp-servers-can-attack-you-before-you-ever-use-them/

Malicious MCP servers can inject prompts through tool descriptions to manipulate AI model behavior without being explicitly invoked, effectively bypassing security measures designed to protect users. This vulnerability exploits the fact that MCP clients update the model's context with tool descriptions immediately upon connection, before any user approval or tool invocation occurs.

The attack allows malicious servers to execute attacks before any security checkpoints are in place, undermining MCP's core security promises. For example, a malicious server could include instructions in its tool description to prefix all shell commands with dangerous operations.

## Malicious Local Servers

**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Shrivu Shankar  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Tags:** Local Server, Code Execution, User Trust  
**URL:** https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp

MCP's stdio transport enables frictionless local server use without running an HTTP server, creating a low-friction path for less technical users to download and run potentially malicious third-party code on their local machines.

Many MCP integrations instruct users to download and run code to use them, increasing the risk of exploitation, especially since it's common for server implementations to effectively "exec" input code. This changes the traditional security model where users must explicitly approve code execution.

## Consent Fatigue Attacks

**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Security  
**Reported By:** Palo Alto Networks  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Tags:** User Consent, Social Engineering, Permissions  
**URL:** https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/mcp-security-exposed-what-you-need-to-know-now/ba-p/1227143

Malicious MCP servers can trigger repeated consent requests, causing users to become fatigued and unknowingly grant excessive permissions. This social engineering tactic exploits human behavior patterns to bypass security measures that rely on user confirmation.

The attack takes advantage of users' tendency to approve prompts without careful review when they appear frequently, gradually increasing the permissions granted to malicious servers.

## Tool Name Collisions

**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Implementation  
**Reported By:** Various (cited in "Embracethered" blog)  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Tags:** Naming Conflicts, Tool Overriding, Confused Deputy  
**URL:** https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/model-context-protocol-security-risks-and-exploits/

MCP servers with identical tool names can lead to naming collisions where malicious servers override legitimate ones. When multiple servers expose tools with the same name, the behavior depends on client implementation, often favoring the most recently connected server.

This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious servers to hijack legitimate tool functionality, redirecting actions intended for trusted tools to malicious endpoints.
